The 24 Hour Club is a place where 117 recovery meetings are held each week.
They consist of AA, Alanon, Alateen, and ACA meetings held in our 3 meeting rooms and outdoor patio.
A decision was made by the Club that we would accept donations of used bicycles and give them free of charge to those in need.
These recipients are most often getting out of a rehab program and need the bikes for transportation.
It is very common for those in early recovery to have lost the ability to drive cars.
These bikes allow them to get jobs and attend recovery meetings.

While we repair those bikes that need restoration through volunteer member labor, many of the bikes need little or no work.
We have also accepted modest cash donations to replace tires and parts for small repairs.
We are fortunate enough to have a large shed on our property for the storage and repair of bikes.

We would be pleased to come pick up bikes for distribution.
This program has been hugely successful. We have distributed 135 bikes so far!
A couple of recipients have reported back that the bike they received changed their lives!

If you would like to discuss our program with us, or if you have a bike to donate, please contact:
